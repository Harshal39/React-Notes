__In React, both state and props are used to manage data and control the behavior of components, but they serve different purposes. Here's a breakdown of their differences:__

## 1. Definition:

### State:
State is used to store and manage data within a component.
It represents the internal state of the component and can change over time.
It is mutable (can be changed) and should be updated using the setState() method in class components or by using state hooks (useState) in function components.

### Props:
Props (short for "properties") are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified by the component receiving them.
Props are set by the parent component, and the child component uses them to render content or determine behavior.


## 2. Purpose:
### State:
State is used for managing data that changes over time, such as user input, API responses, or the state of a UI element (like toggling visibility).
Example: Form input values, whether a modal is open or closed.

### Props:
Props are used to share information between components and allow child components to receive data from parent components.
Example: Passing a title, button text, or an array of items to a child component for display.


## 3. Mutability:
### State:
State is mutable. It can be changed by the component itself, usually via setState() (class components) or useState() (function components).

### Props:
Props are immutable. A component cannot change the props that it receives. The parent component is responsible for passing new or updated props.


## 4. Scope:

### State:
State is local to the component. Each component can have its own state, and it doesn’t affect other components unless explicitly passed as props.

### Props:
Props are passed from parent to child components. They allow parent components to configure or customize the behavior of child components.


## 5. Lifecycle:
### State:
State can be updated and changed over the component’s lifecycle. It determines how the component renders and behaves over time.

### Props:
Props are set when a component is rendered and can change if the parent component re-renders with new values for the props. However, they are not directly manipulated by the receiving component.


## 6. Example:
// Parent component
```javascript
function Parent() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("Hello from Parent");

  return <Child message={message} />;
}

// Child component
function Child(props) {
  return <h1>{props.message}</h1>; // Displays the message passed from Parent
}
```

__In this example:__
Props (message) are passed from the Parent component to the Child component.
State (message) is managed inside the Parent component.

__When to Use:__
- Use state when the data needs to be managed and changed within the component itself (e.g., input fields, toggles).
- Use props to pass data from a parent to a child component when the child does not need to modify it.
